# Spotify-Recommendation-System

According to Spotify's official website, Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs. Spotify is an excellent example of recommendation system engines. We shall here, try to build one such recommendation engine using Spotify dataset based on user input and preference.

Problem Statement and Approach: We have a dataset of spotify tracks over a range of 114000 tracks and 125 different genres. We have built a recommendation system that returns top recommended songs based on user input.

Each track has some audio features associated with it. We have first understood the dataset, cleaned and preprocessed it and performed data visualisation before fitting the data to a Machine Learning Algorithm.

After performing the above steps, we have fitted the data to a clustering Algorithm and have created a function that returns recommended songs to users based on input songs.
